I'm learning rust and decided to play with some of the rust web tools.
I'm sufficiently new to rust that futzing around with various crates
is interesting.  Both [Maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz) and
[Actix](https://actix.rs) looked like fun and indeed they are.

This is hack-and-slash code.  If by peeking at it you find something
useful, that's surprising, but great.  If you see anything that should
be done better, send me email or open an issue.

FWIW, I'm _really_ enjoying Rust and am writing various side projects
in it.  Currently, only [mdck](https://github.com/ctm/mdck) is public.
The first rust program I wrote solves ["Eric's Ultimate
Solitaire"](https://archive.org/details/executor) boards, which I
would get a kick out of compiling into wasm if I knew a way to bring
up a web page an then insert events into it. My guess is that's doable
by writing a browser extension, but I have a few more important things
to work on.
